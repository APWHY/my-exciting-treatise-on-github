Github is an online website which provides project management services. 
These allow you to ‘file’ every single draft of a project in an organised and compact system. 
The advantages provided by Github are most useful when used with a project that require 
collaboration between multiple people, since it has built-in functionality which allows 
for seamless integration of the ongoing work of multiple people. 
While often used with code, Github can in fact be used with other more conventional documents like word documents. 
Github also provides a few other services which allow for the easy sharing for small snippets of code, 
social networking between users, and job listings for users on github.
